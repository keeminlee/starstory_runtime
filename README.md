**Meepo** is a diegetic AI companion for tabletop RPG campaigns.  
She sits quietly beside your party in Discord, listens as the story unfolds, and preserves the adventure in an append-only narrative ledger.

During the game, Meepo roleplays alongside your table as a small in-world presence.  
After the game, she remembers what happened — helping you revisit moments, generate recaps, and build a living chronicle of your campaign.

The goal is simple:

> **Your adventures should never be forgotten.**

## Quick Start

For first-time setup, start here:  
➡ **[docs/START_HERE.md](docs/START_HERE.md)**

### Prerequisites

- Node.js **18+**
- Discord bot token *(Message Content intent enabled)*
- OpenAI API key

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure

Create a `.env` file and set the required values:

- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

Useful runtime toggles:

- `BOT_PREFIX` (default: `meepo:`)
- `LATCH_SECONDS` (default: `90`)
- `LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_SCOPES`, `LOG_FORMAT`
- `OVERLAY_PORT` (if using the OBS overlay)

### Run

```bash
npm run dev:deploy   # register slash commands
npm run dev:bot      # start the bot
```

Once running, invite Meepo to your Discord server and awaken her with:

```
/meepo wake
```

## What Meepo Does

Meepo quietly builds a structured memory of your campaign as it unfolds.

- **In-session listening**  
  Captures dialogue and events as they occur.

- **Narrative ledger**  
  Stores campaign history in an append-only structure.

- **Session recaps**  
  Turns raw events into readable summaries.

- **Campaign memory retrieval**  
  Recall characters, past moments, and narrative threads.

- **OBS overlay support**  
  Optional streaming overlays for live games.

Over time, this ledger becomes a **chronicle of the campaign** — a living memory of your table’s story.

## Philosophy

Meepo isn’t meant to replace a Dungeon Master or automate storytelling.

Instead, she acts as a **companion to the table** — a quiet witness to the adventure who helps preserve what happened.

Campaigns often span months or years, and many stories fade once the game ends.

Meepo exists so that, years later, someone can still ask:

> *“Remember when we fought the giant basilisk?”*

…and the story is still there.
