# Meepo Bot - Context Handoff Document
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Status:** MVP Complete - Text-Only Baseline with LLM Recap

## Project Overview

Discord bot for D&D sessions: in-world NPC (Meepo) that listens, remembers, and converses with strict diegetic boundaries. No omniscience, no hallucination, locality-gated knowledge.

**Current Milestone:** Text-only baseline with LLM integration, session tracking, and persona transformation system.

---

## Core Architecture

### Dual Knowledge System (Foundational Design)
1. **Omniscient Ledger** - Append-only log of ALL messages for DM tooling and recaps
2. **NPC Mind** (future) - Locality-gated knowledge based on what Meepo perceives

**Current State:** Ledger fully implemented. NPC Mind deferred to Week 2+.

## Database Schema (SQLite)

### Tables
```sql
npc_instances
  - id, name, guild_id, channel_id
  - persona_seed (optional custom traits)
  - form_id (default 'meepo', can be 'xoblob')
  - created_at_ms, is_active

ledger_entries
  - id, guild_id, channel_id, message_id
  - author_id, author_name, timestamp_ms, content
  - tags (human | npc,meepo,spoken | system,<event_type>)
  
  -- Voice & Narrative Authority (Phase 0)
  - source (text | voice | system)
  - narrative_weight (primary | secondary | elevated)
  - speaker_id (Discord user_id for voice attribution)
  - audio_chunk_path (nullable, only if STT_SAVE_AUDIO=true)
  - t_start_ms, t_end_ms (voice segment timestamps)
  - confidence (STT confidence 0.0-1.0)
  
  -- Session Grouping (UUID-based invariant)
  - session_id (nullable, references sessions.session_id UUID)

sessions
  - session_id (TEXT PRIMARY KEY) - Generated UUID (the invariant)
  - guild_id
  - label (nullable) - User-provided metadata (e.g., "C2E03" for reference)
  - started_at_ms, ended_at_ms
  - started_by_id, started_by_name
  - source ('live' default | 'ingest-media')

latches
  - key, guild_id, channel_id, expires_at_ms
```

### Important Constraints
- `message_id` has unique index → deduplication (silent ignore on conflict)
- One active NPC per guild
- Sessions auto-start on wake, auto-end on sleep

---

## Narrative Authority System (Day 8 - Phase 0)

### Philosophy: One Ledger, Narrative Primacy

**Core Principle:** The Omniscient Ledger captures EVERYTHING (voice + text + system events), but voice is the **primary narrative source** reflecting D&D as played at the table. Text is secondary unless explicitly elevated.

This is **not** about data capture (everything is stored), but about **narrative authority** (what counts as "the session").

### Source Types
- **`text`** - Discord text messages (default for existing messages)
- **`voice`** - STT transcriptions from voice chat (primary narrative)
- **`system`** - Bot-generated events (session markers, wake/sleep/transform)

### Narrative Weight
- **`primary`** - Default for voice/system (used in recaps, NPC Mind)
- **`secondary`** - Default for text (stored but not primary narrative)
- **`elevated`** - Text explicitly marked important by DM (future: `/mark-important`)

### Default Behavior
- Recaps consume `narrative_weight IN ('primary', 'elevated')` by default
- DM can use `--full` flag to see all sources including secondary text
- NPC Mind (future) will filter to primary narrative + locality gating

### Privacy & Storage
- **No audio persistence by default** - Stream → transcribe → discard
- `audio_chunk_path` only populated if `STT_SAVE_AUDIO=true` (debugging)
- User already records sessions externally; redundant storage avoided

### System Events
Wake/sleep/transform commands now log system events with:
- `source='system'`
- `narrative_weight='primary'`
- `tags='system,npc_wake|npc_sleep|npc_transform'`

These appear in recaps as session markers, providing chronological anchors.

---

## Key Behavioral Rules

### 1. Speaking Scope
- Meepo ONLY replies in bound channel (`active.channel_id`)
- Never speaks outside bound channel (even if addressed)
- Ledger logs ALL messages bot can see (guild-wide for future voice/STT)

### 2. Address Triggers
Meepo responds when:
- Mentioned via `@Meepo`
- Message starts with `meepo:` prefix (configurable via `BOT_PREFIX`)
- Latch is active (90s window after last response)
- **NEW:** Auto-latch after `/meepo wake` or `/meepo transform` for immediate UX

### 3. Latch System
- Set on every response (extends 90s window)
- Cleared via `/meepo hush` or timeout
- Scoped to guild+channel
- **Auto-activated** on wake/transform for better UX

### 4. Ledger Tagging (CRITICAL)
- Human messages: `tags: "human"`, `source: "text"`, `narrative_weight: "secondary"`
- Meepo replies: `tags: "npc,meepo,spoken"`, `source: "text"`, `narrative_weight: "secondary"`
- System events: `tags: "system,<event_type>"`, `source: "system"`, `narrative_weight: "primary"`
- **Include Meepo's replies in context** for conversational coherence
- Recaps show full dialogue (human + NPC)

**Rationale:** Excluding Meepo breaks conversation flow. Meepo's speech is part of world history, but NPC Mind (future) won't treat it as authoritative evidence.

---

## Persona System (Day 7 Feature)

### Architecture
Personas define **identity, guardrails, speech style, and optional memory seeds**.

```typescript
type Persona = {
  id: string;
  displayName: string;
  systemGuardrails: string;   // Anti-hallucination rules
  identity: string;            // Who they are, diegetic boundaries
  memory?: string;             // Canonical fragments (optional)
  speechStyle: string;         // How they speak
  personalityTone: string;     // Tone and safe patterns
  styleGuard: string;          // Strict style rules for isolation
  styleSpec: StyleSpec;        // Compact spec for generating styleGuard
}

type StyleSpec = {
  name: string;
  voice: "gentle" | "neutral" | "chaotic";
  punctuation: "low" | "medium" | "high";
  caps: "never" | "allowed";
  end_sentence_tag?: string;   // e.g., "meep"
  motifs_allowed?: string[];   // Phrases this persona CAN use
  motifs_forbidden?: string[]; // Phrases this persona NEVER uses
}
```

**StyleSpec System:** Clean, maintainable persona definitions using compact specs that compile into consistent style firewall text via `compileStyleGuard()`.

### Current Personas

#### `meepo` (Default)
- Newborn celestial servant of the Wanderer
- Baby-simple grammar, short sentences
- **Every sentence ends with "meep"**
- Gentle, curious, cautious
- Knows he can transform but doesn't understand how ("remembering someone very hard")

#### `xoblob` (Entity-13V Echo)
- Mimic form: Meepo echoing Old Xoblob
- Riddles, rhymes, sing-song cadence
- Cheerful but unsettling ("grandfatherly but wrong")
- **NO "meep" suffix**
- Has memory seeds: "I see a bee ate a pea" motif, Rei phrases
- Hard rule: never reveal passwords directly, only fragments

### Transform UX
```
1. /meepo wake              → Always default Meepo form
2. /meepo transform xoblob  → Switches to Xoblob speech style
3. /meepo transform meepo   → Returns to default
```

**Diegetic Constraint:** Transform is **mimicry**, not possession. Meepo doesn't gain secrets/memories/knowledge. Guardrails remain absolute.

---

## LLM Integration (Day 5)

### Configuration
```env
LLM_ENABLED=true              # Kill switch for testing
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini         # Fast, cheap, good quality
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.3           # Low for consistency
LLM_MAX_TOKENS=200            # Keep responses concise
```

### Prompt Assembly Order
```
Guardrails (anti-hallucination)
    ↓
Identity (who they are, diegetic boundaries)
    ↓
Memory (optional canonical seeds, Xoblob only)
    ↓
Speech Style (how they speak)
    ↓
Personality Tone (examples, safe patterns)
    ↓
Custom Persona Seed (from /meepo wake [persona])
    ↓
Context (last 15 ledger messages)
```

### Guardrails (Universal)
- Only reference events in provided context OR persona memory
- Never invent plot/lore/facts
- Admit uncertainty when info missing
- Prefer silence over speculation
- "These rules are absolute and more important than being helpful"

---

## Commands Reference

### `/meepo wake [persona]`
- Binds Meepo to current channel
- Creates session record
- Sets `form_id = 'meepo'` (always default)
- **Auto-activates latch** for immediate response
- Optional `persona`: custom traits to shape responses

### `/meepo sleep`
- Deactivates Meepo
- Ends active session
- Clears latch

### `/meepo status`
- Shows: awake/sleeping, bound channel, current form, persona, created timestamp

### `/meepo hush`
- Clears latch manually
- Meepo goes silent until addressed again

### `/meepo transform <character>`
- **NEW:** Switches persona (meepo | xoblob)
- Choices presented as dropdown
- **Auto-activates latch** for immediate response
- Flavor text: "Meepo curls up... and becomes an echo of Old Xoblob."

### `/session transcript <range>` (DM-only)
- **Display raw session transcript from ledger**
- Ranges: `since_start`, `last_5h`, `today`, `recording` (latest ingested session)
- Outputs chronological dialogue with timestamps and source/weight annotation: `[ISO8601] (source/narrative_weight) Author: content`
- `primary` flag filters to primary + elevated narrative only (voice-first content)
- No summarization - verbatim ledger slice
- `range=recording` uses `getLatestIngestedSession()` for offline ingestion sessions
- **Auto-sends as .txt file** if transcript exceeds 1950 characters
- DM-only via `DM_ROLE_ID` env check

### `/session recap <range> [mode]` (DM-only)
- **LLM-generated session summary** with multiple output formats
- Ranges: `since_start`, `last_5h`, `today`, `recording` (latest ingested session)
- Mode options:
  - `primary` (default): Voice + elevated text only (DM-important narrative)
  - `full`: All narrative entries (full context with secondary messages)
  - `meecap`: Structured scenes/beats + character arc tracking (narrative summary with story shape)
- Output structure (for primary/full modes):
  - Overview (3-6 sentences)
  - Chronological Beats
  - NPCs & Factions
  - Player Decisions & Consequences
  - Conflicts & Resolutions
  - Clues, Loot, & Lore
  - Open Threads / To Follow Up
- **Meecap mode** (`generateMeecapStub`): Produces beat-based structure optimized for D&D narrative arcs
- **Auto-sends as .md file** if summary exceeds 1950 characters
- `range=recording` uses `getLatestIngestedSession()` (guild-scoped, with fallback to global)
- DM-only via `DM_ROLE_ID` env check

**Architecture:** `recap = summarize(transcript(slice))` - single source of truth for ledger slicing.

---

## Critical Design Decisions

### 1. Narrative Authority vs Data Capture (Day 8 - Phase 0)
**Decision:** One omniscient ledger with narrative weight tiers.

**Rationale:**
- Voice is primary because D&D is played at the table (diegetic primacy)
- Text is secondary chatter unless explicitly elevated
- Everything is captured (omniscient), but primacy defines "the session"
- Recaps/NPC Mind default to primary narrative (voice + system + elevated text)
- DM can query full ledger for diagnostics (omniscient view)
- No audio persistence by default (user already records sessions)

### 2. Ledger Includes Bot Replies (FINAL)
**Decision:** Log Meepo's replies with `npc,meepo,spoken` tags and include in context.

**Rationale:**
- Conversational coherence requires seeing full dialogue
- Without Meepo's replies, recaps are nonsensical
- Meepo's speech IS part of world history
- NPC Mind (future) will filter Meepo's words from belief formation
- 15-message limit prevents runaway feedback loops

### 3. Transform is Mimicry, Not Omniscience
**Decision:** Transformation changes speech style only; no new knowledge granted.

**Diegetic Rules:**
- Meepo is always Meepo (identity preserved)
- Echoes remembered speech patterns, not true mind
- Guardrails remain absolute across all forms
- Persona memory seeds are "fixed fragments," not omniscience

### 4. Auto-Latch on Wake/Transform
**Decision:** Automatically activate latch after wake/transform commands.

**Rationale:**
- Better UX - no need to explicitly address after intentional wake
- Wake/transform IS an addressing action
- Still bound to channel (no omnipresence)
- Can be cleared with `/meepo hush`

### 5. Session Auto-Tracking
**Decision:** Sessions start on `/meepo wake`, end on `/meepo sleep`.

**Rationale:**
- Simpler than manual `/session start/end`
- Natural mapping: Meepo's presence = session active
- Voice-first use case (sessions track when NPC is "listening")

---

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Node.js 18+ with tsx (no build step)
- **Discord:** discord.js v14
- **Database:** better-sqlite3 (WAL mode)
- **LLM:** OpenAI SDK (gpt-4o-mini)
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode, no decorators

---

## Migration Path & Migrations

### Database Migrations (Auto-Apply)
Applied via `getDb()` in src/db.ts on startup:
```typescript
// Migration: Add form_id to npc_instances (Day 7)
ALTER TABLE npc_instances ADD COLUMN form_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'meepo'

// Migration: Add voice/narrative fields to ledger_entries (Day 8 - Phase 0)
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN source TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'text';
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN narrative_weight TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'secondary';
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN speaker_id TEXT;
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN audio_chunk_path TEXT;
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN t_start_ms INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN t_end_ms INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ledger_entries ADD COLUMN confidence REAL;
```

Future migrations follow same pattern - check column existence, apply if missing.

---

## Common Workflows

### Development Iteration
```bash
# Make code changes
npm run dev:bot        # Start bot

# If commands changed
npm run dev:deploy     # Re-register slash commands
```

### Testing Flow
```
1. /meepo wake persona:grumpy scout
2. Send "hi" (no prefix) → Meepo responds (auto-latch works)
3. Natural conversation for 90s
4. /session transcript last_1h
5. /session recap last_1h
```

### Voice Testing Flow (Phase 1-2 Complete)
```
1. /meepo wake
2. Join a voice channel
3. /meepo join → Bot joins voice
4. /meepo stt status → Shows connected, STT disabled
5. /meepo stt on → Enables audio capture
   - Console: [Receiver] Starting receiver...
6. Speak normally → Console: 🔇 Speaking ended: audioMs=..., activeMs=..., peak=...
7. Keyboard click → Silently gated (or debug log if DEBUG_VOICE=true)
8. /meepo stt off → Stops receiver
9. /meepo leave → Disconnects from voice
```

---

## Voice Integration Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1: Voice Presence (COMPLETE)
- `/meepo join` / `/meepo leave` commands
- Voice connection via `@discordjs/voice`
- `/meepo stt on|off|status` commands (toggle transcription)
- GuildVoiceStates intent enabled
- Receiver-ready setup (selfDeaf: false, selfMute: true)
- Clean disconnect handling with state cleanup

**Files:**
- `src/voice/state.ts` - In-memory voice state tracking
- `src/voice/connection.ts` - Voice connection lifecycle
- `src/commands/meepo.ts` - Join/leave/stt commands

### ✅ Phase 2: Audio Capture & Gating (COMPLETE - Tasks 1-3)

#### Tasks 1-2: Audio Capture & Gating (COMPLETE)
- Per-user audio stream subscription with `EndBehaviorType.AfterSilence` (250ms)
- Opus decode → PCM via prism-media
- Conservative anti-noise gating:
  - Minimum audio: 250ms of actual PCM content (not wall-clock time)
  - Activity-based filtering: 20ms RMS frame analysis (MIN_ACTIVE_MS = 200ms)
  - Per-user cooldown: 300ms (prevents rapid retriggers)
  - Long audio (≥1.2s) bypasses activity gate and cooldown
- Duplicate subscription prevention
- Stream lifecycle finalization (not speaking state)
- Clean log levels (operational always-on, debug-gated noise)

**Files:**
- `src/voice/receiver.ts` - Audio capture, PCM decode, frame-level gating + STT integration

**Dependencies:**
- `@discordjs/voice` - Voice connection and receiver
- `prism-media` (via @discordjs/voice) - Opus decoding

**Current Logs:**
- Always: `Starting receiver`, `Stopping receiver`, `Speaking ended: displayName, audioMs=..., activeMs=..., peak=...`
- Debug only: `Speaking started`, `Gated: reason=...`, stream errors

#### Task 3: STT Provider Interface (COMPLETE)
- Pluggable STT provider interface in `src/voice/stt/provider.ts`:
  - `transcribePcm(pcm, sampleRate)` returns `{ text: string; confidence?: number }`
  - `getSttProvider()` factory reads `STT_PROVIDER` env var (defaults to noop)
  - `getSttProviderInfo()` returns provider name + description for UI
- **NoopSttProvider** (`src/voice/stt/noop.ts`): Returns empty text (silent, tests pipeline)
- **DebugSttProvider** (`src/voice/stt/debug.ts`): Returns test transcripts like `"(voice heard N, X.Xs)"` (99% confidence)
- Receiver calls STT on accepted utterances (after gating passes, async non-blocking)
- Ledger emission with full voice attribution:
  - `source='voice'`, `narrative_weight='primary'`
  - `speaker_id=userId`, `author_name=member.displayName` (cached at capture start)
  - `t_start_ms`, `t_end_ms`, `confidence`
  - Synthetic `message_id=voice_{userId}_{timestamp}_{randomSuffix}` (collision-safe)
- Memory safety: `MAX_PCM_BYTES=10*BYTES_PER_SEC` (truncate + log on overflow)
- `/meepo stt on` displays active provider + behavior in reply

#### Session Command Improvements
- `/session transcript` shows `(source/narrative_weight)` inline for each entry
- `/session transcript --primary` filters to primary/elevated narrative only (default: show all)
- `/session recap` defaults to primary-only (voice + elevated text, voice-first narrative)
- `/session recap --full` includes secondary narrative (text chat)
- Mode headers: "mode: primary" or "mode: full"
- `getLedgerInRange()` supports `primaryOnly?: boolean` parameter

**Files:**
- `src/voice/stt/provider.ts` - Interface + factory
- `src/voice/stt/noop.ts` - Silent provider
- `src/voice/stt/debug.ts` - Test provider
- `src/voice/receiver.ts` - STT integration + member name caching
- `src/voice/state.ts` - Added guild reference for member lookup
- `src/commands/meepo.ts` - STT mode line on stt on
- `src/commands/session.ts` - Added --primary and --full flags
- `src/ledger/ledger.ts` - Added primaryOnly filter support

### ✅ Phase 3: Real STT (OpenAI Whisper Audio API)

**Completed Tasks:**

- ✅ **Task 3.1** — OpenAI STT Provider (`src/voice/stt/openai.ts`)
  - Converts PCM (16-bit LE, 48kHz mono) → WAV in-memory
  - Calls OpenAI Audio API with configurable model (default: `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`)
  - Retry logic: max 1 retry on 429/5xx/network errors (250-500ms jitter backoff)
  - No confidence score (OpenAI doesn't provide for transcriptions)

- ✅ **Task 3.2** — Provider Factory Wiring
  - Lazy-loaded, cached singleton per bot lifetime
  - `getSttProviderInfo()` displays model name in user messages
  - `/meepo stt on` shows: "openai (real transcripts via OpenAI Audio API (gpt-4o-mini-transcribe))"

- ✅ **Task 3.3** — WAV Encoder (`src/voice/stt/wav.ts`)
  - `pcmToWav(pcm, sampleRate, channels=1): Buffer`
  - Correct RIFF/WAVE header (16-bit PCM little-endian)
  - Verified OpenAI Audio API accepts output

- ✅ **Task 3.4** — Per-Guild Concurrency & Queuing
  - Replaced busy flag with promise-chaining queue
  - `Map<guildId, Promise<void>>` ensures serial FIFO execution
  - No utterance loss if speakers overlap
  - Memory-bounded (only stores Promise reference, not buffers)

- ✅ **Task 3.5** — Minimal Retry Logic
  - Transient error handling: 429 (rate limit), 5xx, network reset/timeout
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (250-500ms)
  - Max 1 retry per utterance, then fail with logged error

- ✅ **Task 3.8** — Post-STT Domain Normalization (`src/voice/stt/normalize.ts`)
  - Pure regex-based canonicalization (no LLM, no prompt)
  - Entities: Meepo, Xoblob, Corah Malora, Henroc, Kayn
  - Case-insensitive, word-boundary aware, multi-word support
  - Togglable: `STT_NORMALIZE_NAMES=true` (default: enabled)
  - Applied before ledger append; debug logging shows raw→normalized diff

**Environment Variables (Phase 3):**
```
STT_PROVIDER=openai                    # Provider selection
STT_OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini-transcribe # Model choice
STT_LANGUAGE=en                        # Audio language (optional)
STT_NORMALIZE_NAMES=true               # Enable domain name normalization
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...             # Reuse from LLM
```

**Key Fixes:**
- Fixed prompt echo bug: Removed `STT_PROMPT` from transcriptions API (Whisper treats prompt as preceding text, not vocabulary hints)
- Updated `END_SILENCE_MS` from 250ms → 700ms to support natural speech pauses

**Backlog (Low Priority):**
- **Task 3.6** — Optional Audio Persistence (debug-only WAV saving to `./data/audio/<guild>/<session>/<timestamp>_<user>.wav`)
- **Task 3.7** — STT Smoke-Test Command (synthetic PCM verification)

### ⏳ Phase 4: Voice-Aware LLM Integration & TTS Output

**Completed Tasks:**

- ✅ **Task 4.1** — TTS Provider Interface (`src/voice/tts/provider.ts`)
  - Async factory pattern matching STT provider design
  - Supports: noop (disabled), openai (production)
  - `getTtsProvider()` lazy-loads and caches singleton

- ✅ **Task 4.2** — OpenAI TTS Implementation (`src/voice/tts/openai.ts`)
  - Text → MP3 audio via OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini-tts` model  
  - Sentence-boundary chunking (splits on `.!?` to preserve context)
  - Max `TTS_MAX_CHARS_PER_CHUNK=350` (default, configurable)
  - MP3 buffer concatenation (monitoring for potential glitches; fallback ready in 4.3)
  - Configurable voice: `TTS_VOICE=alloy` (default)

- ✅ **Task 4.3** — Voice Speaker Pipeline (`src/voice/speaker.ts`)
  - AudioPlayer-based playback into VoiceConnection
  - Per-guild playback queue using promise chaining (FIFO, no overlap)
  - MP3 buffer → AudioResource with prism-media MP3→Opus transcoding
  - Meepo-speaking tracking for feedback loop protection
  - `speakInGuild(guildId, mp3Buffer)` queues playback sequentially
  - Playback waits for idle state before resolving (prevents overlap)
  - Integrated speaker lifecycle: cleanup on disconnect via `cleanupSpeaker()`

- ✅ **Task 4.4** — `/meepo say` Command (`src/commands/meepo.ts`)
  - DM-only slash command with `/meepo say <text>` interface
  - DM-only enforcement via DM_ROLE_ID check (matches /session command pattern)
  - Preconditions: Meepo awake, in voice channel, TTS_ENABLED=true
  - Synthesizes text to MP3 audio via `getTtsProvider().synthesize()`
  - Queues playback via `speakInGuild()` with metadata
  - Logs system event with tags: `system,tts_say`, source: `system`, narrative_weight: `primary`
  - No LLM invocation, no latch state change, no chat reply (control command only)
  - Graceful error handling with user-facing precondition messages

- ✅ **Task 4.5** — Feedback Loop Protection (`src/voice/receiver.ts` + `src/voice/speaker.ts`)
  - Gate implemented: `isMeepoSpeaking()` check before STT queue
  - Always logs: `[Receiver] 🔕 Gated (meepo-speaking): [user]` (visible in production)
  - Prevents Meepo from transcribing its own TTS output
  - Safe by default: blocks all overlapped speech (push-to-respond expected)

- ✅ **Task 4.6** — Wake-Word Voice Reply (STT → LLM → TTS Loop Closure)
  - **Address Detection** (`src/voice/wakeword.ts`):
    - `isAddressedToMeepo(text, formId)`: Triggers on "meepo X", "hey meepo", "meepo:", "meepo,"
    - Optional persona displayName support (e.g., "xoblob")
  - **Voice Reply Handler** (`src/voice/voiceReply.ts`):
    - Preconditions: awake, in voice, not speaking (4.5 gate), cooldown passed (5s default)
    - LLM context: last 120s of primary narrative only
    - Response: max 100 tokens (shorter for voice UX)
    - TTS synthesize, queue playback via speaker pipeline
    - Log as system event: `eventType: voice_reply`, source: `system`, narrative_weight: `primary`
  - **Integration** (`src/voice/receiver.ts`):
    - Hook after STT appends transcript
    - Async, non-blocking voice reply handler
    - All preconditions checked inside handler

**Completed (Tasks 4.7-4.8):**
- **Task 4.7** — LLM Voice Context
  - **Function:** `getVoiceAwareContext()` in `src/ledger/ledger.ts`
  - Pulls entries from last `LLM_VOICE_CONTEXT_MS` (default 120s)
  - Prefers `source='voice'`, `narrative_weight IN ('primary', 'elevated')`
  - Filters out system events (noise)
  - Returns formatted context with speaker attribution: `Name (voice): content`
  - **Integration:** Updated `buildMeepoPrompt()` to accept `hasVoiceContext` flag
  - Adds hint: "Recent dialogue was spoken aloud in the room. Respond naturally, briefly..."
  - Both `bot.ts` (text replies) and `voiceReply.ts` (voice replies) use shared function
- **Task 4.8** — Voice-First Recap Polish
  - System state events marked as `narrative_weight='secondary'`:
    - `npc_wake`, `npc_sleep` (state changes)
    - `voice_join`, `voice_leave` (technical state)
    - `stt_toggle` (technical state)
  - Narrative-significant events remain `primary`:
    - `npc_transform` (character transformation)
    - `tts_say`, `voice_reply` (Meepo speaking)
  - `/session recap` defaults to `primaryOnly=true` (voice + elevated text)
  - `getVoiceAwareContext()` explicitly excludes system tags
- **Audio FX Pipeline** (Post-TTS Effects)
  - **Module:** `src/voice/audioFx.ts` - FFmpeg-based optional audio processing
  - **Feature:** Pitch shift (rubberband filter) + reverb (aecho filter)
  - **Env Vars:**
    - `AUDIO_FX_ENABLED=true|false` (default: false)
    - `AUDIO_FX_PITCH=1.05` (default: 1.0, no shift)
    - `AUDIO_FX_REVERB=true|false` (default: false) — **⚠️ In backlog for tuning**
    - `AUDIO_FX_REVERB_WET=0.3` (wet gain, default: 0.3)
    - `AUDIO_FX_REVERB_DELAY_MS=20` (delay in ms, default: 20)
    - `AUDIO_FX_REVERB_DECAY=0.4` (decay amount, default: 0.4)
  - **Integration:** Integrated into both `/meepo say` and voice reply pipeline (applies before playback)
  - **Error Handling:** Fail-safe — returns original audio on any FFmpeg error, never blocks playback
  - **Status:** Pitch shift working; reverb tuning deferred to backlog

### ⏳ Phase 5: Text Elevation
- `/mark-important <message_id>` (DM-only) → Sets `narrative_weight='elevated'`
- Auto-elevate: commands, transforms, NPC state changes
- Optional: Auto-elevate text addressed to Meepo when in voice

### ⏳ Phase 6: TTS Output
- Meepo speaks responses in voice when joined
- Persona-specific voices (OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs)

**Voice/Narrative Migration:** Old databases get voice/narrative fields added with safe defaults (`source='text'`, `narrative_weight='secondary'`)

---

## Gotchas & Important Notes

1. **PID Lock:** Bot uses `./data/bot.pid` to prevent multiple instances. If you see "Bot already running" on startup, either kill the existing process or delete the stale lock file if the process crashed.

2. **Message Content Intent:** Must be enabled in Discord Developer Portal or bot can't read messages

3. **GuildVoiceStates Intent:** Required for voice channel detection. Must be enabled in code (`GatewayIntentBits.GuildVoiceStates`) - not a privileged intent.

4. **View Channel Permission:** Bot must have "View Channel" permission to receive events

5. **Unique Message ID:** Ledger deduplication handles this gracefully (silent ignore), but duplicates shouldn't happen

6. **Form ID Migration:** Old databases get `form_id='meepo'` auto-added on startup

7. **Whisper Name Recognition:** Whisper already excels at recognizing names once heard naturally in speech. Domain normalization layer ensures consistent casing in ledger without prompt contamination.

- (Phase 5+) NPC mind, more personas, advanced features
- 🔄 **Backlog:** Audio FX reverb tuning (aecho decay calibration)


**Next Steps - Phase 5:**
- **Text Elevation:** `/mark-important` command (DM-only, sets `narrative_weight='elevated'`)
- **Auto-elevation:** Commands, transforms, text addressed to Meepo in voice
- **NPC Mind:** Personas maintain memory across sessions

**Backlog (Lower Priority):**
- Audio FX reverb parameter tuning (currently using conservative defaults; may need calibration for perceptual taste)

**Test Manual TTS (Task 4.4) — Ready to deploy:**
```bash
npm run dev:bot
```

In Discord:
```
/meepo wake
/meepo join
/meepo say "Hello, adventurers!"  # Should play in voice channel
/meepo say "Long text here..." # Should chunk and queue
```

**Test Voice Capture (Phase 3 validation):**
```
/meepo stt on
<speak normally> → Console shows STT transcript
<stay quiet 700ms> → Silence gate prevents utterance
```

## Gotchas & Important Notes

1. **PID Lock:** Bot uses `./data/bot.pid` to prevent multiple instances. If you see "Bot already running" on startup, either kill the existing process or delete the stale lock file if the process crashed.

2. **Message Content Intent:** Must be enabled in Discord Developer Portal or bot can't read messages

2. **View Channel Permission:** Bot must have "View Channel" permission to receive events

3. **Unique Message ID:** Ledger deduplication handles this gracefully (silent ignore), but duplicates shouldn't happen

4. **Form ID Migration:** Old databases get `form_id='meepo'` auto-added on startup

5. **Latch Scope:** Currently guild+channel key. Could be refactored to channel-only if multi-guild support needed.

6. **Transform vs Persona Seed:**
   - `form_id`: Which persona definition to use (meepo, xoblob)
   - `persona_seed`: Optional custom traits from `/meepo wake [persona]`
   - Both can coexist: transform changes base persona, seed adds flavor

**Recent Major Changes (Day 11 - Session Architecture & Recording Support):**

#### Session ID Invariant Fix (Critical)
- ✅ **Problem:** Session ID was user input (`args.sessionLabel`), causing collision risk on re-ingestion
- ✅ **Solution:** 
  - Session ID now **generated as UUID** (immutable invariant, `sessions.session_id`)
  - User metadata stored separately as `sessions.label` (e.g., "C2E03")
  - Prevents silent merges/overwrites when re-ingesting same label (e.g., "C2E03" vs "C2E03-fixed")
- ✅ **Implementation:**
  - Added `label TEXT` column to sessions table
  - Updated `startSession()` signature: `opts: { label?, source? }` (options object for extensibility)
  - UUID generation via `randomUUID()` in both `startSession()` and ingestion tool
  - Ledger entries now reference session_id (UUID), not label
  - All queries use `getLedgerForSession(sessionId)` with UUID parameter

#### Recording Range Support (Offline Ingestion)
- ✅ **Feature:** `/session recap range=recording` and `/session transcript range=recording`
- ✅ **Use Case:** Query sessions created via offline ingestion tool (media files)
- ✅ **Implementation:**
  - `getLatestIngestedSession(guildId)` helper: finds most recent session with `source='ingest-media'`
  - Two-tier fallback: guild-scoped first, then global (supports offline_test guild)
  - Query via `getLedgerForSession()` (session_id UUID-based, no time-window ambiguity)
  - Settable via `startSession({ label, source: 'ingest-media' })`

#### Ingestion Tool Updates
- ✅ Updated `tools/ingest-media.ts` schema to match main bot schema
- ✅ `createSessionRecord()` now generates UUID, returns it for ledger entries
- ✅ `writeLedgerEntries()` accepts `sessionId: string` parameter
- ✅ Reordered in main pipeline: create session first (generates UUID), then write ledger with that UUID
- ✅ All ingested entries properly grouped by session_id invariant

#### DM Command UX Polish
- ✅ Mode options renamed for clarity:
  - `primary` → Voice + elevated text (focus on DM-important beats)
  - `full` → All narrative entries (full transcript context)
  - `meecap` → Structured scenes/beats with character arcs (narrative summary)
- ✅ Mode selection via dropdown in Discord slash command

#### Gotchas Fixed
1. ✅ **SQLite DEFAULT doesn't backfill existing rows**: Added explicit `UPDATE` statement in migration
2. ✅ **Time-window ambiguity for recording sessions**: Shifted to session_id (UUID) based queries
3. ✅ **Guild scoping for offline sessions**: Added fallback query for global session lookup

---

**Recent Major Changes (Day 10 - Phase 2 Complete):**
- ✅ Phase 2 Task 3 complete: STT provider interface (pluggable, testable)
- ✅ NoopSttProvider: Silent (tests full pipeline without real transcription)
- ✅ DebugSttProvider: Emits test transcripts `"(voice heard N, X.Xs)"` with 99% confidence
- ✅ Receiver calls STT on accepted utterances (async, non-blocking cleanup)
- ✅ Ledger emission: voice entries marked `source: voice`, `narrative_weight: primary`
- ✅ Member display names: Voice entries show `"Keemin"` not `"User_28802586"` (guild member fetch cached at capture start)
- ✅ Message ID collision fix: Random suffix prevents millisecond collisions
- ✅ Session improvements: `/session transcript --primary`, `/session recap` voice-first by default
- ✅ Provider mode line: `/meepo stt on` displays active provider behavior
- ✅ Full pipeline verified: gating → STT → ledger → recap (tested with debug provider)

**Read This First:**
- README.md (user-facing docs)
- This file (developer handoff)
- src/personas/*.ts (to understand identity system)
- src/voice/receiver.ts (audio capture pipeline)
- src/commands/meepo.ts (voice commands)

Good luck! 🎲
